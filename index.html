                <p class="header-p">Loanwords is a generative art project that explores how language evolves through cultural exchange. It creates new, made-up words derived from existing loanwords—English terms borrowed from various other languages. The new terms are embodied as dynamic symbols that interact with one another to form ever-changing representations of culture.</p>

                    <p class="content-p"> The project explores the linguistic phenomenon of borrowed language through a generative and visual lens. A loanword is a term adopted from one language (the donor language) and integrated into another (the recipient language). This project reimagines loanwords by creating entirely new ones through a generative process, transforming language into a dynamic experience.</p>
                    <p class="content-p">At the heart of the project is a probability model that generates new words derived from a curated list of English loanwords. These new words are then deconstructed into their individual letters. Each letter is represented by a custom-designed symbol—a hybrid of typographic elements that reflect how the letter’s sound is articulated across multiple languages. These symbols are not static; each one is imbued with simulated physical properties informed by its unique shape, influencing how it behaves and interacts with the other letters present in the space.</p>
                    <p class="content-p">The visualization is presented within petri-dish-like displays—a playful nod to the "cultures" that shape language. Within these microcosms, new loanwords materialize at regular intervals, forming an ever-evolving narrative that blends typography, sound, and movement. Loanwords invites viewers to reflect on the fluidity of language, the interconnectedness of cultures, and the intricate relationships between form, meaning, and sound.</p>
